**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a young, hungry poet confronts their aging idol, accusing them of selling out the very movement they founded.
- Draft a monologue from Lucien Bell's perspective, explaining why he believes corrupting Kerwood's legacy is a necessary and purifying act.
- Create a 'found poem' assembled from advertising slogans, corporate memos, and social media posts, in the style of a corrupted Beat poem.
- Describe a pivotal, silent moment between Kerwood and Corso in the back office of The Galleon, where their decades-long friendship fractures over money and principle.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Beat Corruption Engine'—a text transformer that takes a passage of authentic, emotional writing and systematically rewrites it in the style of corporate jargon, advertising speak, or hollow social media performance.
- Create an interactive map of North Beach, San Francisco, circa 1964, plotting real and fictional Beat landmarks, with audio clips of poetry that decay into advertisements as the user 'sells out' locations.
